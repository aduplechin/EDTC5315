Today, we're bringing a math concept to life: how to find the volume of a square pyramid.
First, let's draw the base — a square. This is the foundation of our pyramid. Watch as we pull vertical lines upward and connect them simultaneously. Now, we can see the whole 3D shape: a square pyramid.
To find the volume, we use the formula: Volume equals one-third times the area of the base times the height. Let's break that down.
Zooming into the base, we calculate the area: side times side. The base area is 144 square inches if each side is twelve inches.
Next, we look at the height — the straight-line distance from the base to the top point. If the height is twelve inches, we multiply the base area by the height: 144 times 12 equals 1,728.
Finally, we multiply by one-third (divide by 3). So, 1,728 divided by 3 gives us 576 cubic inches. That's the volume!
