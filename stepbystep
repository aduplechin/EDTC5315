STEP 1: Set Up Your Project
1.	Open Adobe Animate.
2.	Click "Create New" > HTML5 Canvas.
3.	Set:
•	Stage size: 1280 x 720
•	Frame rate: 24 fps
•	Background color: white or light gray
4.	Click "Create".
STEP 2: Draw the Table and Pyramid
2A. Draw the Table
1.	Select the Rectangle Tool (Shortcut: R).
•	Found in the Tools panel (left side).
2.	Click and drag to draw a flat rectangle near the bottom of the stage (this is your "table").
3.	Optional: Use the Fill color in the Properties Panel (right side) to change its color.
2B. Draw the Pyramid (manually)
We'll build the Pyramid from triangles and a square.
Step 1: Draw One Triangle (Pyramid Face)
1.	In the Tools panel, click and hold the Rectangle Tool.
2.	Select Polygon Tool from the dropdown.
3.	In the Properties panel (right side), under Polygon Settings:
•	Set sides = 3 to make a triangle.
4.	Click and drag on stage to draw the triangle.
•	Rotate if needed using the Free Transform Tool (Q) – icon: 
Step 2: Make 3 More Triangle Faces
1.	Select the triangle (click once).
2.	Press Ctrl + D (Duplicate).
3.	Use the Free Transform Tool to rotate and position the other three triangles to make a 3D-ish pyramid.
Step 3: Add the Square Base
1.	Select the Rectangle Tool.
2.	Draw a square beneath the triangles to form the base.
3.	Use the Align panel (Window > Align) to center and line up the shapes.
Step 4: Group the Whole Pyramid
1.	Use the Selection Tool (V) to select all the shapes.
2.	Right-click > Convert to Symbol.
•	Name: Pyramid
•	Type: Movie Clip
3.	Now, the whole Pyramid is one object.
STEP 3: Animate the Floating, Tilting, and Spinning
3A. Create a New Layer for the Pyramid
1.	Make sure your Pyramid is on its layer.
2.	Rename it Pyramid.
3B. Convert to Motion Tween
1.	Right-click on frame 1 of the Pyramid layer → Create Motion Tween.
2.	Drag the timeline to frame 60 → right-click → Insert Keyframe.
Floating Up:
•	In frame 1: Pyramid on the table.
•	At frame 24, Move the Pyramid up slightly using the Selection Tool (grab and drag).
•	This simulates floating.
Tilting:
•	At frame 36: Use Free Transform Tool (Q) to slightly tilt (rotate Z axis).
•	You may rotate it about 10 degrees.
Spinning:
•	At frame 60: Rotate the Pyramid to +100° on the Y axis.
•	Using Classic Tween or frame-by-frame, use Free Transform to rotate it visually.
STEP 4: Animate Base Expansion & Camera Zoom
4A. Separate Base from Pyramid (optional)
1.	If you want to animate only the base:
•	Double-click the Pyramid to enter Edit Symbol mode.
•	Select the base only.
•	Cut it (Ctrl + X), edit the exit symbol, and paste it on a new layer (Ctrl + Shift + V).
4B. Animate Base Growth
1.	Select the Base layer.
2.	Insert Keyframes at frame 60 and frame 75.
3.	At frame 75, use the Free Transform Tool to scale the base slightly.
4C. Add the Camera Zoom
1.	Click the Camera Icon above the timeline (top-left of layers).
2.	This adds a camera layer.
Zoom In:
•	At frame 60, Add a keyframe to the Camera layer.
•	At frame 90: Use the Camera Tool (Shift + T or click the camera icon) to zoom in and pan toward the base.
STEP 5: Show Base Measurements and Area
5A. Show “12 inches x 12 inches”
1.	Add a new Text Layer.
2.	At frame 95, use the Text Tool (T) to type:
3.	12 inches x 12 inches
4.	Position above or near the base.
5.	Right-click > Create Classic Tween if you want it to fade in.
•	In Properties > Color Effect > Alpha, animate from 0% to 100%.
5B. Multiply and Show Area
1.	At frame 105, add another text:
2.	12 × 12 = 144 square inches
STEP 6: Show Height and Volume Calculations
6A. Zoom Out Again
1.	Go back to the Camera Layer.
2.	At frame 115, insert Keyframe.
3.	At frame 130, reset zoom using the Camera Tool to show the complete Pyramid again.
6B. Show Pyramid Height
1.	At frame 135, add new text:
2.	Height = 12 inches
6C. Show Volume Formula
1.	In frame 145, new text:
2.	144 × 12 = 1,728 cubic inches
3.	In frame 155, new text:
4.	1,728 ÷ 3 = 576 cubic inches
STEP 7: Polish & Export
7A. Add Easing (Optional)
1.	Click on a tween span.
2.	In the Properties panel, under Tweening, select Ease In or Ease Out.
7B. Preview Animation
•	Press Ctrl + Enter to test the animation.
7C. Export
