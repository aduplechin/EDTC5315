I created an Adobe Animate project to visually demonstrate how to find the volume of a square pyramid. The project was designed specifically to help students bridge the gap between paper-based math problems and dynamic visualization. The animation begins with a simple square base drawn on the stage, followed by vertical lines rising to a single apex point to form the 3D pyramid. Using Animate’s tools, I incorporated motion tweens to gradually build the shape, helping students mentally break down how the pyramid is structured.
Next, I animated the formula for volume — V=1/3×Base Area × Height — alongside clear labeling of the base and height. A guided camera movement zooms into the base to show how the area is calculated and then pans upward to reinforce the connection between the base and the height. Throughout the animation, I used color changes, keyframe-by-keyframe construction, and simple motion effects to reinforce each step.
This project not only teaches the math behind the volume of a square pyramid but also shows students how to use Adobe Animate to bring their problem-solving process to life. This gives them stronger mental models and improves their ability to visualize and explain math concepts creatively.
